#### Description

This single-page application was built with React, Bootstrap5, and Square appointments, deployed on Netlify, can be used as a medical or massage clinic website.
React is a JavaScript front-end framework, it has several features like easy to learn and use, reusable components, SEO friendly, and have many supported JavaScript libraries.
It's easy to use bootstrap to build a decent front end UI.
Square appointments is an third-party online booking service, it provides a variety of useful features, like choose and employee, choose appointment data and time, email and text notification, and more. 
The reason I choose to build this web app is because I found some local clinic's website is not good enough, some use out-of-date UI, some didn't provide needed functions like appointment booking system.
Since I started my CS50x study in October 2021, I have to finish the course before December 31, 2021, so I didn't have enough time to build a customize booking system. So I choose an third-party one - 
Square appointments. I will try to replace it with my own app.

PS: For account safety reasons, the booking system will be only shortly showed in the live demo.

#### Introduce the file structure and content:

public: static files like index.html and favicon.ico 
src: builded components and images, index.js-main enternce, app.js-import conponents, and index.css-style the whole site along with bootstrap.
node_modules: It contains all dependencies and sub-dependencies specified in package.json used by React app.
.gitignore: This file is tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project, so the files/folders list in this file won't be updata to github repo.
package.json: It is a JSON file used for managing the projectâ€™s dependencies, scripts, version.
package-lock. json: It is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree or package.json. 
It helps while a team is working on private apps to ensure that they are working on the same version of dependencies and sub-dependencies. 
It also maintains a history of changes done in package.json so, that at any point of time, when required previous changes can be looked back in the package-lock.json file.
